# Community Needs Assessment
*11/28/2022*


**Initial Goal: Look at Prosperity Home Mortgage (PHM), and write code in Python to analyze the lender portfolio.**



**Long term Goal: Set up automated tool that will create automated analysis for both Lender and Auditor through the analysis done with PHM.**

## What do we want to show?

### 1. Comparison of total portfolio to PA Average

Bin income values and show average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio by the binned income

### 2. Tract by Tract comparison of total portfolio to PA Average

Same two statistics, but calculate difference from national mean for that tract, and show those values. Tracts with large differences should be flagged

### 3. Loan Portfolio by Size, Debt-to-Income Ratio, and Credit Score

Breakdown of Loan Portfolio, with comparatives to National Average.

### 4. Accepted Loans with "suspicious" income

Any large loans with low income, or extremely high debt to income ratio. Does interest rate match?

### 5. Denied Loans with suitable income

Any loans with high income, or extremely low debt to income ratio. Does interest rate match?

### 6. Loan Portfolio impact on Tract vacancy

Are any areas that have particularly high interest rates showing a similarly high rate of vacancy? Where is the most impacted area?
